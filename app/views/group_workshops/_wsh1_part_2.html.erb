        <p>In this part of the workshop, we will be discussing the five stages of behavioral change. Understanding these stages is essential in guiding patients towards lasting behavior change.</p>
        <p>We will explore each stage, from pre-contemplation to maintenance and relapse, and learn how to identify where a patient is in their journey towards change. With this knowledge, GPs can tailor their approach to best suit the patient's needs, increase the likelihood of success, and reduce the risk of relapse.</p>
