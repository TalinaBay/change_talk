        <p>Effective communication is crucial in healthcare to ensure high-quality patient outcomes. Health literacy, the ability to obtain and understand health information, plays a significant role in health outcomes. Poor health literacy can result in low adherence to treatment and health recommendations, poor health outcomes, and increased medical costs.</p>
        <p>When patients don't understand the information given to them during a consultation, they may not be able to indicate that they don't understand. This could lead to confusion about what to do next and poor adherence to instructions, which may be misread as "low motivation".</p>
        <p>The "teach-back" method is a communication approach that can help address this issue. In this method, the healthcare provider presents information to the patient and asks the patient to repeat it back in their own words to assess comprehension. The definition of the method varies, but they all include a cyclical process of assessing and reassessing patient understanding. However, inconsistencies exist in definitions regarding follow-up steps for information gaps or misunderstandings, the number of cycles, and the inclusion of a framing phrase to reduce patient stigma.</p>
