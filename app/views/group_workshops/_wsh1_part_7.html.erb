        <h2>Activity: "Exploring Misjudged Motivation"</h2>

        <p>In this second activity, we will delve into the topic of patients who may appear unmotivated, exploring the possibility of misjudged motivation. </p>

        <p>As healthcare professionals, it's important to recognise the need to identify potential barriers that may affect patients' preparedness for behaviour change, such as low health literacy. The goal of this group activity is to improve one's comprehension of patient motivation through discussions and shared experiences in order to provide a foundation for more efficient and sympathetic care.</p>

        <p>We invite either a new volunteer or the same volunteer from the first activity to share their notes on a patient encounter where motivation seemed lacking.</p>
